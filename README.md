# World-Bank-Education-Analysis-EDA1
The World Bank Ed Stats All Indicator Query holds over 4,000 internationally comparable indicators that describe education access, 
progression, completion, literacy, teachers, population, expenditures and many such indicators .The indicators cover the education 
cycle from pre-primary to vocational and tertiary education and also holds learning outcome data from international and regional 
learning assessments (e.g. PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS), equity data from household surveys, and projection/attainment data.
I am exploring and analyzing the data to identify variation of indicators across the globe, which countries are more alike and different, 
which countries show more closeness to global standards and what are the actual driving force behind such growth.
