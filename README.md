The World Bank Ed Stats All Indicator Query holds over 4,000 internationally comparable indicators that describe education access, 
progression, completion, literacy, teachers, population, expenditures and many such indicators .The indicators cover the education 
cycle from pre-primary to vocational and tertiary education and also holds learning outcome data from international and regional 
learning assessments (e.g. PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS), equity data from household surveys, and projection/attainment data.
I am exploring and analyzing the data to identify variation of indicators across the globe, which countries are more alike and different, 
which countries show more closeness to global standards and what are the actual driving force behind such growth.

# Standard Operating Procedure:

In the process of Exploratory Data Analysis I followed a particular procedure for obtaining best outcome from the data:


1.	Importing required packages for    analysis.
2.	Mounting drive and reading data files from Google drive.
3.	Viewing all data information.
4.	Checking unique values, null count and datatypes of each column.
5.	Identifying the problem statements.
6.	Doing concatenation, groupby , sorting and aggregating operation to come up to relevant data frame.
7.	Doing data visualization as per the problem statements.
8.	Finding Insights from the data visualization.
9.	Giving recommendations.

# Data Cleaning Operation:

1.	To observe the probable trends, I tried to make full out of the given dataset.
2.	I replaced the null values with zero.
3.	With this the Year would not be dropped from the comparative analysis data frame of more than one indicator at once.
4.	Later on When I need to find out the mean of newly  formed desired  data frames , I replaced those zeros back with their respective null values . So that the mean should not be affected.

# Project Summary


  UNESCO has formulated the all new Education 2030 Framework for Action, to define the standards for various indicators 
whichwould be followed by countries. Such 3666 indicators have been studied by the World Bank since 1970. The Ed Stats data set 
is the result of such an endeavor by the World Bank.\
  	Since history various studies and surveys have been conducted by the countries for their growth in education. Kothari Commission, 
 one of such commissions appointed by India in 1965, had recommended various improvements required for the growth of the country after 
extensive, hardcore studies and research. The World Bank has made these studies and surveys followed by research and all, very easy by 
accumulating every type of data under one umbrella.\
   	Exploratory Data Analysis is following the same pattern of studies and research which has been followed by other surveys but with 
slight difference. With the aid of Data Science and World Bank such analysis becomes possible with more insightful studies and easy 
comprehendible trends. EDA for various countries would help them to understand the historical perspective for their actions and policies.
Data Analysis via World Bank dataset made the understanding of trends available at the disposal of every country and their government.\
 	The Dataset comes with tons of relevant trends and significant data. It has a huge amount of blank values and vacant spaces for 
most of the country specific data. This recommends the countries to judiciously observe their data in order to monitor their growth and increments.
Projects like this could help countries to establish a new world order with better educational trends. It will help countries to improve world 
enrollment, gender parity in education , reduce inequality among both sexes , improve employment , would help India to tap the ‘Demographic Dividend’,
It will increase the Women’s participation in the workforce. All these improvements could be finalized by their own countries, only by analyzing 
the proper data and implementing the desired recommendations.\
   	Long story short, it will make the world observe the substance and matter behind the growth of developed countries in terms of their 
education actions and framework. It will open the domain of comparative analysis and would take the youth to their next level of life.
Finally Education is the avenue for Independence , Freedom And Liberty of a Conscious Mind.


# Conclusion/Recommendations
1.	Despite the positive results , the Gross enrollment and Lower secondary completion rate is not up to the global average for Arab World Countries. The countries should be focusing on, increasing the participation of students and their completion.
2.	The direct outcome of United Kingdom chart is , government expenditure on education is very much influencing factor for the changes in unemployment rate of countries.
3.	Japan have balanced the public expenditure at 4 % , but still succeeded in making significant enhancements. Countries should follow the case studies of Japan who has the stagnated education indicators.
4.	Argentina shows very close connections with public expenditure. In second level of analysis Argentina shows the depressed trends with less expenditure.
5.	Botswana spend nearly 10 % of GDP on education but failed in improving the employment rate and pupil teacher ratio.
